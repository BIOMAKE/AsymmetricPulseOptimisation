# AsymmetricPulseOptimisation
This repository contains the `CSV files` for the optimised asymmetric E-field pulses shown in the Paper "Optimisation of asymmetric field pulses for transcranial magnetic stimulation".
* `Opt_` means optimised waveforms.
* `V-100+1000` means that the negative voltage limit is 100 and the positive voltage limit is 100.
