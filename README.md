# AsymmetricPulseOptimisation
1.  `CSV files` contains the recorded optimised asymmetric E-field pulses shown in the Paper "Numerically optimised asymmetric electric field pulses for selective rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation".
* `Opt_` means optimised waveforms.
* `V-100+1000` means that the negative voltage limit is 100 and the positive voltage limit is 100.
