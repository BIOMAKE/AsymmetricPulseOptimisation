# AsymmetricPulseOptimisation
This repository contains the CVS files for the optimised asymmetric field pulses shown in the Paper "Optimisation of asymmetric field pulses for transcranial magnetic stimulation".
* `Opt_` means optimised waveforms.
* `V+1000-100` means that the upper voltage limit is 1000 and the lower voltage limit is 100.
