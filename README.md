# AsymmetricPulseOptimisation
1.  `CSV files` contains the recorded optimised asymmetric E-field pulses. These waveforms were generated by a modular pulse synthesizer TMS (MPS-TMS) device with six modules.
  * `Opt_` means optimised waveforms.
  * `V-100+1000` means that the negative voltage limit is 100 and the positive voltage limit is 100.
2. `OptimisedWaveforms` contains the optimised asymmetric E-field pulses.
  * `MonophasicPhaseSummary` in both `.xlsx` and `mat` are files summarising optimised waveforms.
